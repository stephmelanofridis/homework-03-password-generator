# Password Generator

For this project I was provided some starter code featuring HTML and CSS. I was required to add Javascript to this code to create a webpage that can generate a random password for a user based on criteria they have selected. 


# Technologies used

In this project I was provided with HTML and CSS to start. I added checkboxes to the HTML that would allow a user to be able to select whether they would like lowercase, uppercase, numerals and symbols included in their randomly generated password. I then wrote the Javascript that generates a password based on this criteria when the generate password button is clicked.
